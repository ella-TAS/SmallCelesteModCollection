# Small Celeste Mod Collection

A repository collecting all my smaller or map-specific code mods for Celeste.

Here is the list:
- Aroxon Berry - a "no-midair-jump" winged strawberry, requires defining `ghost_aroxon_berry` and `aroxon_berry` in Sprites.xml to give it graphics
- Badeline Hair Dye ([Reverse Card skin mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/251787)) - gives Madeline's hair color to Badeline
- [Bloom Command](https://gamebanana.com/mods/53703) - a mod that adds a `bloom` console command similar to the vanilla `lighting` command
- Cabob Berry Swap ([Frozen Heights](https://gamebanana.com/mods/150681)) - changes the GUI strawberry icon (now possible with [max480's Helping Hand](https://github.com/EverestAPI/ModResources/wiki/Helping-Hand-Extra-Features#reskinning-strawberries-in-menus))
- [Display Message Command](https://gamebanana.com/mods/421935) - a mod that provides a simple command that displays arbitrary text on-screen, in the same style as the strawberry counter
- [Event Mode](https://gamebanana.com/mods/53674) - a tiny mod that puts Celeste in a hidden "event mode"
